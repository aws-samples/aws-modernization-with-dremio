# Dremio Modernization Workshop

In this workshop, you will learn how Dremio, the cloud data lake service, empowers users to run live, fast, and interactive queries directly against billions of rows of data in their own data lake storage. Gain a hands-on introduction to Dremio through deployment and exploration of Dremio’s user interface and features, followed by a comprehensive walkthrough of two common use cases:
● A data engineer scenario where you will create a space and enhance a dataset for a data science team
● A data analyst scenario where you will find, validate, and analyze data using a popular BI tool
