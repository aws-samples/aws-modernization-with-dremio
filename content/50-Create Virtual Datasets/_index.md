<div style="text-align: justify">

In this section you are going to create a physical dataset from parquet files in the Amazon S3 bucket you just connected to. Once your physical dataset is created, you will then build and save virtual datasets for others in your organization to use. You will then explore and leverage “Reflections” in Dremio to help accelerate the query performance of the dataset.
