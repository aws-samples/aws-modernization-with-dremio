    <center><h2>Set up a Space to collaborate with other users</h2></center>
  

    <ol>
        <li>   From the Dremio home screen click the  <b>"+"</b> icon  next to <b>“Spaces” </b>.  
 </li>
         <li>  Provide a name for your Space. Here, you can also manage users and roles. For the purposes of this workshop, we will not be adding additional users. You will, however, want to give All Users permission to Select, Alter, Alter Reflection, View Reflection, Manage Grants, and Modify, so hover over each column and click the check mark so it fills in green. After you have done so, click “Save”. 
</li>
