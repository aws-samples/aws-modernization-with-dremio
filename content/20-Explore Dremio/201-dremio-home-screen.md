    <ol>
        <li><b>Home Space</b></li>
        The Home Space is a private user work area that can contain both physical and virtual datasets.  Uploaded files promoted to a physical dataset are stored in the home space.  Data can be curated in the home space until its ready to be shared by moving it to a shared space. 
        <li><b>Spaces</b></li>
        Spaces are shared locations for saving virtual datasets. Spaces allow grouping datasets by a common theme such as a project or geographic region.  Each space can be configured for sharing and other privileges.  Users will not see spaces for which they have no authorization. 
        <li><b>Data Connections</b> </li>
        Dremio can connect to a variety of Data Lake storage and External Sources.  This area is where you create and manage your different data connections
        
        <li><b>Home Space Wiki</b></li>
        You can create and edit information for any source, space, or folder.  This sidebar always shows the wiki for the current source, space or folder you are browsing.
