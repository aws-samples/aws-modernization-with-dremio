<div style="text-align: justify">
 In this section you are going to combine what you have learned in this lab by creating a new Physical Data Set from your Data Lake Storage and then saving it as a Virtual Dataset.  Next you are going to make sure the VDS is properly prepared for analysis.  Finally, you will learn how to join datasets in Dremio and then connect the new joined table to Tableau to perform your analysis and create visualizations.
