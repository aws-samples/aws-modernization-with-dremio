      <description>Now that you have quickly connected Dremio to Tableau you can start to explore different tables without having to copy any of the data into Tableau. After a successful connection has been made Tableau will direct you to the “Data Source” tab in your new workbook.   From the Data Connections tab in your Tableau workbook, select the following from the dropdown menus    Under “Database”, select “DREMIO” Under “Schema”, enter the name of your Dremio Homespace (where you saved your VDS) Under Table, enter the name of the VDS (NYC_Taxi) that you saved in Dremio   Your Tableau Inputs should look like this (IP Address &amp; Schema name will be different)  Drag the NYC_Taxi table from the left side under “Connections”  to the center of the workbook where it says  “Drag Tables Here”   Now that you have connected Dremio to Tableau and selected the Table to analyze, you can now start creating visualizations.</description>
