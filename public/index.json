A Background in AWS Glue and other AWS Analytics services is not required, but they may come in handy. Workshop Goals: \n Section 1: Deploying Dremio  Section 2: Explore Dremio Home Screen  Section 3: Connect Data Source  Section 4: Exploring a Dataset  Section 5: Creating a Virtual Dataset (VDS)  Section 6: Connecting to Tableau  Section 7: Exploring Dremio Jobs  Section 8: Exploring the Dataset in Tableau  Section 9: Joining Datasets in Dremio\nThe examples and sample code provided in this workshop are intended to be consumed as instructional content. These will help you understand how various AWS services can be architected to build a solution while demonstrating best practices along the way. These examples are not intended for use in production environments.  "

	"content": "How it works\nBefore we go ahead and work on deploying Dremio, let us understand what is Dremio and how it works. Dremio is a SQL Lakehouse Platform that delivers fast interactive queries directly on S3 using an Apache Arrow-based engine and end-to-end query acceleration techniques such as columnar caching, transparent materialized views, and vectorized execution.   Data science applications and BI tools can connect to Dremio using Arrow Flight, ODBC, JDBC and REST interfaces. For data science applications in particular, Arrow Flight provides up to a 1000x increase in throughput over ODBC/JDBC using parallel high-speed transfers.   In addition, Dremio offers a semantic layer making it easy to transform and aggregate data from one or more sources into virtual datasets without the need for complex pipelines. The platform provides a combination of role-based access controls, row- and column-level permissions, and data masking to ensure secure and governed access to these datasets.   Data stays in the customer’s AWS account and is stored in open formats, providing the flexibility to use multiple analytic services without vendor lock-in.    In this section, we’ll cover the following topics:  Deploying Dremio    Configuring and Launching Dremio   Creating the Dremio CloudFormation Stack   Launching Dremio and Setting up a Dremio Project    "

Now you are going to examine how each month of the year impacts the surcharge of a taxi ride. To do this first you are going to drag “Pickup_Date” to the columns bar and select Month from the drop down.   **Remember we are looking for the sum for each month not a month over month comparison** Now drag the surcharge measure to the rows bar. Tableau automatically selects the Sum of the records. For this lab, we want to see the total amount of Surcharge dollars spent so we will keep it at sum.   Now that you have a measure and dimension you should see a chart that shows the sum of surcharge by each month. Tableau automatically choose the line chart for this visualization but we want to see this as a bar chart. Under the Marks box, click the dropdown menu next to Automatic and select “Bar” Your visualization should look like this: Which month is the highest for Surcharges? March   "
